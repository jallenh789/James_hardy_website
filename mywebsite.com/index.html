      <p>Title: My Web Developer Journey</p>
      <p>My web developer journey began with a simple curiosity of what it would be like to have disposible income. So I did what any person in this day and age would do... I googled how to make more money and most of the answers were along the lines of "get a second job", "sell a kidney", or "go back to school" so I choose the later. then the big question, what to go back to school for? well i figured the intenet got me this far maybe it could take me further so that why i choose web dev. Next to who would teach me? and I picked Correlation One because amazon would pay for it....... yep that was it... you know for the whole not having money thing.... moving on.</p>
      <p>when i started this course going from zero to advanced HTML felt a bit like drinking from a fire hose. However it started to click in place once i got a supplementary training app SoloLearn. now that really helped to hammer home alot of the html concepts just through sheer repetition. if a nail won't go in you just gotta hit it a few more times and that should do the trick. that has been a good lesson for me to learn if i want to make this a career that Im going to have to put in some repetitive work.</p>
